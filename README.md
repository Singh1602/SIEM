# SIEM
The Lightweight SIEM System is a security tool designed to collect, analyse, and store logs for monitoring cybersecurity threats. It integrates with Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana (ELK Stack) to provide real-time insights into system activity. The system continuously scans log files, detects suspicious patterns such as failed logins and unauthorised access, and raises alerts for potential security breaches.

By leveraging Elasticsearch, logs are indexed for fast retrieval and analysis. Logstash processes the logs and forwards them to Elasticsearch, while Kibana provides a dashboard for visualisation. The system also applies custom alert rules to detect security incidents, helping administrators respond to threats efficiently.

To use this system, users need to install the required dependencies, configure Elasticsearch and Logstash, and set up Kibana for monitoring. Once deployed, the SIEM system enhances an organisation's ability to identify, track, and mitigate cybersecurity threats in real-time.
